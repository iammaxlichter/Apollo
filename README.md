We've designed an innovative finnance app for all.
<br>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
We were inspired by a vision to make investing easily accessible to all, regardless of income or past investing experience.That's why we set out to create a platform that incorporates a variety of financial principles (such as beta values and required returns) with the understanding that the needs of our clients vary greatly based off of their respective situations.

<br>
<h2>What it does</h2>
Our platform utilizes strong form efficiency to calculate beta values and expected returns of a variety of stocks. Then, utilizing a survey, we discern an individual's risk preference and advise them accordingly, taking into account the volatility of a stock (beta value) against its expected return (using inflation as the risk-free rate and the S&P's average over the past 5 years as the market rate of return). On the front end, we provide the customer with clear and concise advice on which stocks would be the best investments for them.
